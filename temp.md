# Learning Gamified

## Inspiration

1. Educational Technology: The rise of educational technology has made it possible to create engaging learning experiences that go beyond traditional classroom settings. Learning Gamified is inspired by the idea of using technology to make learning more fun and accessible.
2. Gamification: The concept of gamification involves using game design principles to make non-game activities more engaging. Learning Gamified is inspired by the idea of using gamification to make learning more enjoyable and effective for the student.

## What it does

Welcome to our website, Learning Gamified where we offer interactive games for students of all ages. Our website is divided into two sections : one for school children and another for college students. Our games are interactive and designed to make learning fun and engaging. They are accessible to students of all levels, from beginners to advanced learners. Our website is user-friendly and also very easy to navigate, making it easy for students to find the games they need to enhance their learning experience. We hope you enjoy using our website and learning through our interactive games.

## How we built it

- HTML: For the structure of the website
- CSS: For the styling of the website
- JavaScript: For the interactive elements of the website
- Python & Flask: For the backend of the website involving routing and machine learning model training and prediction
- Git & GitHub: For version control and collaboration via pull requests
- PythonAnywhere: For hosting the website
- RevealScroll.js: For the smooth transition while scrolling
- Parallax: Innovative way to style the website using JavaScript

## Website Sections

### School

The school children's section includes fun and engaging games such as Simon game, card-flip game and a math game. Each of these games are specially designed to help children improve their cognitive skills memory and problem solving skills while having fun at the same time.
The Simon game is a memory game where the player must repeat a pattern of colored lights and sounds. The card flip game involves flipping cards and matching pairs to improve memory skills. The math game is a fun and interactive way for children to improve their math skills, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### College

In the college section, we offer more advanced things like RSA encryption, Morse code encryption and machine learning. These games are aimed at college students who want to learn and improve their technical skills.
Encryption is a section that teaches students how to encrypt and decrypt messages using the RSA and the Morse code algorithm. Machine learning involve training algorithms to recognize patterns and make predictions based on data. We use our custom-trained ML Image Classification Model to predict the name of a wild cat based on an image of the cat. The model is trained on a dataset of 10 different wild cat species. The model is integrated into the website and the user can upload an image of a wild cat and get the name of the cat as the output.

## Challenges we ran into

Integrating ML Model into the website and accurately mapping the generated categorical output to the wild cat name for prediction, making fun games to teach relevant concepts, synchronizing the music according to the events in the card game,

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to overcome the above challenges and package everything in a beautiful website that is visually appealing.

## What we learned

Gained experience and knowledge in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as backend development using Python and Flask. We also learned about integrating machine learning models into web applications and overcoming technical challenges related to that process.

## What's next for Learning Gamified

Addition of more games and refinement of existing website, along with more quizzes and a reward system.
