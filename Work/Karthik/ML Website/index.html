      <h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence which focuses on
        the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way humans learn. Machine
        Learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, which is known
        as "training data", to make predictions without explicitly being
        programmed to do so. The larger the dataset used, the greater is the
        accuracy since the computers learn from the data provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        Machine Learning is used in a variety of applications, such as in
        medicine, computer vision, speech recognition and other fields where it
        is difficult to develop conventional algorithms ot perform the required
        task.
      </p>

      <h3>How a Machine Learning algorithm works</h3>
      <p>
        The learning system of an ML algorithm can be broken down into three
        parts:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>The Decision Process</b>: The algorithm is used to make a
          prediction or a classification. So based on some input data, which can
          either be labeled or unlabeled, the algorithm produces an estimate
          about a pattern in the data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Error Function</b>: An error function evaluates the prediction of
          the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a
          comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Model Optimization</b>: If the model can fit better to the data
          points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the
          discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The
          algorithm will repeat this “evaluate and optimize” process, updating
          weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What can you do with Machine Learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Here is an ML model that is built for <b>Wild Cats Prediction</b>. It
        takes the image of any wild cat like a lion, cheetah, snow leopard etc.
        as the input and gives the name of the animal.
      </p>
      <h4>How the ML model works</h4>
      <p>
        The Python language is used to write the code for the model, so
        knowledge of it is a must. There are a number of steps that are involved
        in building such a machine learning model, some of them are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><h4>Importing the required libraries</h4></li>
        <p>
          First step is to import the libraries needed, like the Data Science,
          Visualization, Tensorflow and a few other libraries.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Visualizing the images from the dataset</h4></li>
        <p>
          Various wild cat images have been used to train the model, like the
          images of a lion, clouded leopard, cheetah, caracal, jaguar etc.
        </p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="wild-cats.jpg" alt="wild-cats" width="500" />
        </div>
        <li><h4>Training the model</h4></li>
        <p>
          The images are loaded and are run with the created model. An
          <em>epoch</em> is when all the training data is used at once and is
          defined as the total number of iterations of all the training data in
          one cycle for training the machine learning model. More epochs can
          lead to better accuracy.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Model Evaluation</h4></li>
        <p>
          Once an image is given as input and is run, the
          <em>Test Accuracy</em> is returned as a percentage value. This enables
          the user to see how accurately the model is able to identidy the given
          picture and whether further improvement is required.
        </p>
